### General

<!-- TODO Units, conversation of Units. Significant numbers, Системы счисления. Четные/нечетные/натуральные/действительные -->

\\(k\*x + k\*y = k\*(x+y)\\): Factorization. Decomposition into a product of multiple factors.

\\(\Delta x, \delta x\\): small difference of some value. Here the value is \\(x\\).

**infinitesimal** Infinitely small value

### Functions
\\(f(x)\\): \\(f\\) of \\(x\\).

\\(k*f(x)\\): \\(k\\) times a function \\(f\\) where \\(k\\) is a factor and \\(f(x)\\) is a factor.

**Function composition** When \\(f\\) is a function of \\(t\\) and \\(t\\) is a function of \\(x\\) we have a composition of functions.
\\[f = g(x), x = h(t) \text{ or } f = g(h(t))\\]
For example. The temperature of a ship is a function of its distance to the sun. The distance is a function of time. So, in the end the temperature is the function of time.

### Trigonometry
**Unit circle** A circle with the radius of \\(1\\)

**Circumference** The enclosing boundary of a curved geometric figure, especially a circle. For circle is \\(2\pi r\\).

**Number \\(\pi\\)** .Pronounce as *pie*. Constant. The ratio of circle's circumference to its diameter.

**Radians** Unit of angle measurement. We take a unit circle. The length of an arc is the radians measurement of the angle that it subtends. So the angle is one radian if the length of its arc is \\(1\\)

**Sin, Cos**. Pronounce as *sign*, *cosign*. Functions of angle. \\(cos=\frac{\text{adjacent}}{hypotenuse}\\), \\(sin=\frac{\text{opposite}}{hypotenuse}\\)
