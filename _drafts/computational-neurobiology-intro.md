Computational Neurobiology is about building computational models in the field of Neurobiology. Neurobiology is Biology that studies brain. It really takes a lot of fancy words to describe what "building computational models" means so I'd prefer to do it by example.

There are three layers of abstraction: neuron inner workings, neuron representation, group of neurons, e.g. so called network of neurons.

We start building them by making very abstract conceptual models. For example lets take a neuron
